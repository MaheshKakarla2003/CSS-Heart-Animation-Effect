# 💖 CSS Heart Animation Effect

A simple and elegant **heart animation effect** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and a little bit of **JavaScript**.  
When the heart is clicked, it triggers a beautiful pop animation, giving a lively “like” or “love” effect similar to social media icons.

## 🧱 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – for structure  
- **CSS3** – for layout, shapes, and animations  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – for handling click events and triggering the animation

---

## 💡 What This Project Demonstrates

- Creating custom shapes using **CSS `transform` and `border-radius`**
- Using **pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`)** to build heart halves
- Applying **CSS keyframe animations** for smooth transitions
- Controlling animations dynamically using **JavaScript event listeners**
- Managing visibility and scale changes for animation effects

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Two overlapping divs (`gray-heart` and `red-heart`) form the base structure.  
2. The gray heart is always visible.  
3. When clicked, the red heart toggles visibility and triggers the **`pop`** animation.  
4. The `@keyframes pop` enlarges the heart and fades it out to create a “burst” effect.
